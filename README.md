# RegistrationAndLoginSystem

Registration and Login system is a web application created in Python using Django. It is basically a Django Sign Up and login with Email confirmation.

In this web application, the user will be able to register on the website, and then the user will also receive a confirmation email in order to activate his/her account. After that, the user can log in to the system at any time.

Django by default provides an authentication system configuration. User objects are the core of the authentication system. In this project I have implemented Djangoâ€™s authentication system.

Apart from django, HTML is used for creating some pages.
